# identifier: either a host name or IP adress in "dotted-quad" format. The port

# and two optional items.  `feedset` is a set of feed types to request.
# `host_pattern` is an extended regular expression that specifies which hosts
# are allowed to receive data products whose feed type is in `feedset`.
# `ok_pattern` is an optional extended regular expression that a product
# identifier must match in order to be sent to the requesting LDM.  The default
